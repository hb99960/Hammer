HammerTime is an Online Auctioning (or e-auctioning) android application. This is just like an Open Market (a great place) where people can sell and find deals where offline retailers cannot match. However, auctions require dedicated attention and some people are unable to access theirs computers so this android application is useful for those busy people. People from anywhere in the world can bid or sell their item in this online auction. Auctions do not all end at the same time, and some end at inconvenient hours. Most auctions end during the evening, but some people work evening shifts and cannot take advantage of these auctions. In addition, some auctions end during the day, and those who are working may not be able to access these sites. As a result, bidders may find that a quick flurry of activity pushes an item beyond their bids. If the auction ends before they have a chance to respond, they may lose the auctions.
